- when append new components to the body first
- because their parent might not yet be ready
- do not allow new router transaction if already changing/busy
- to avoid flickering, add element initially to a hidden region
- dim the empty text in the empty page
- approach component.js differently
	- load the page, then extract the javascript to be primary
	- 
	
- get rid  of Example class and use functional instead

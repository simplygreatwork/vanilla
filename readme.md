## Overview
- These are tiny libraries to use as infrastructure for JavaScript single page applications with single file components

## Goals
- ideal for building prototypes quickly
- no build process, just load and go
- HTML-centric view development
- event-oriented router

## Features
- lightweight message bus which supports overriding features (decoupling)
- lightweight single file components (could even be rendered server side)
- lighweight router with enter and exit events per path part (controller)
- lightweight state management (model)
